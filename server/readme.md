## Instructions

Here goes your frontend application. Advised is to use `ExpressJS` since this is the E in MEAN, MERN or MEVN (described as MEXN for this project).
Also a favourite of mine is `NestJS` this resembles Spring (in Java) and Angular (as frontend with modular architecture).

Express: `npm install express`
NestJS: `nest new .`

Within the `.env` file within the `server` folder add the `http://localhost:xxxx` from your client add the database name from your mongodb and also generate a random secret here (I advise using the devtoys extension).
